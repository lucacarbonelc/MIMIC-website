**Project MIMIc: een project om de rol van media in het leven van jongens en meisjes anno 2020-2025 te begrijpen**

“Do young people mimic the lifestyles they encounter on their social media feed and in entertainment fiction?” is at the core of the research conducted by the MIMIc team in Belgium, France and Slovenia across 3000 adolescents. The project seeks to learn how young people enrich their lives with the affordances offered by the rich digital media landscape in which they grow up. Moreover, we aim to obtain a better understanding of how youth think and feel about being online all the time, constantly exposed to an unlimited stream of information on how their peers organize their lives on social media and in popular entertainment media, such as television shows or music.

To build this knowledge, we are conducting various types of studies. In a first set of studies, we analysed the content of celebrities and influencers popular among youth. In this research, we analysed the content of 4117 popular music lyrics and found that artists tend to showcase their luxurious lifestyles, such as showing their expensive cars, and to depict how hard they work to obtain such expensive goods. Moreover, we found that celebrities, influencers and athletes share the political content they care about, and portray the (moral) values they find important in life. These values often revolve around caring for and being loyal to their loved ones, achieving many successes and engaging in fun activities. 

In a second set of analyses, we followed a group of 405 youngsters in Belgium, 415 in France, and 560 in Slovenia aged 12 to 18. By surveying their activities over the course of 1 year, these studies aim to see how adolescents grow-up in a mediated world. Subsequently, we followed the social media activities of adolescents in Belgium, France, and Slovenia to more closely monitor their online behaviors on Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. The analyses for these studies are still ongoing, and their results will be posted as soon as they are published in academic journals.

Employing data from 1,046 Slovenian adolescents, we also developed two new scales that (a) capture the positive experiences with digital media (link), and (b) measures the perceived digital well-being in the social, cognitive, and emotional domains of adolescents’ lives [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.975557/full). In addition, we conducted a large analysis among 82 published articles synthesizing the existing research about how music, a very popular medium among adolescents, influences the attitudes of its listeners [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qKiSL7zD4SUHM0FdDVPjbpFBwMTrXGf/view).

Finally, we will soon conduct a new study in October 2023 where we will be monitoring youngsters through daily surveys to better understand their day-to-day interactions with social and entertainment media.
