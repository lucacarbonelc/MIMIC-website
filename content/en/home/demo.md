Project MIMIc: A project to understand the role of media in boys’ and girls’ lives anno 2020-2025

“Do youth mimic the lifestyles they encounter at their social media walls and in entertainment fiction?” is at the core of the research that the MIMIc team conducts in Belgium, France and Slovenia across 4,500 adolescents. The project is targeted at learning how youth enrich their lives with the affordances offered by the rich digital media landscape they grow up. Moreover, we would like to find out how youth think and feel about being online all the time and processing an unlimited stream of information on how other peers at social media or in popular television shows and movies organize their lives. To build this knowledge, project MIMIc takes up a multi-method design meaning we will (1) look at the social media profiles of youth and the celebrities and influencers who are popular among youth, (2) follow a group of youngsters aged 12 to 16 years old over the course of 1.5 years to see how grow-up in a mediated world and (3) monitor youth to survey them on a day-to-day basis what the daily interactions with social media and popular TV shows mean.
