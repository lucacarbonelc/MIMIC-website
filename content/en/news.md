- **Title**: “I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown”: Intersectional Representations of Social Status in Popular Music Lyrics
- **Authors**: Luca Carbone, Priscila Alvarez-Cueva, Laura Vandenbosch
- **Abstract**: Music artists are crucial sources of inspiration about what it means to be successful and to have a high status. Previous literature has mostly focused on economic factors, such as luxurious jewels, but has ignored other fundamental dynamics in the definition of status, namely social relationships and power dynamics, especially sexual ob(sub)jectification. Adopting an intersectional Bourdieusian perspective, this article analyzed a unique dataset of 4117 lyrics popular on Spotify between 2016 and 2019 in six countries (US, UK, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada). A manual analysis of these lyrics showed that almost half (46%) of the songs depicted status in terms of economic capital, 26% through social capital, 16% through cultural capital, and 6% through sexual ob(sub)jectification. Most of these representations were present in Rap music and among Black and Brown men artists. We concluded by discussing these results in relation to an increasingly globalized music industry and artists’ well-being.

### 19 September 2022

The third and final wave data collection of the time study was completed in September 2022. 1242 youth aged between 12 and 18 fully completed the questionnaire in the three countries. 335 youth participated in Belgium, 386 in France and 521 in Slovenia. The survey was about the social media, smartphone, tv series and music with some questions about youth themselves and the society. Participants were informed about some key results emerging from this wave with a debriefing in their respective country language.

### 01 September 2022

MIMIc members Jasmina Rosič, Luca Carbone, and Laura Vandenbosch publish the first article of the MIMIc project, titled "Positive digital communication among youth: The development and validation of the digital flourishing scale for adolescents". The article is available at the following [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9474732/).

### 20 June 2022

Closing of the data donation study.

### 01 June 2022

The second wave data collection of the time study was completed in May-June 2022. 1791 youth aged between 12 and 18 fully completed the questionnaire in the three countries. 415 youth participated in Belgium, 580 in France and 796 in Slovenia. The survey was about the social media, smartphone, tv series and music with some questions about youth themselves and the society. Participants were informed about some key results emerging from this wave with a debriefing in their respective country language.

MIMIc members, Anaëlle Gonzalez, Jasmina Rosič, and Luca Carbone, will soon present the first studies of their PhDs at two conferences, the Etmaal van de Communicatiewetenschap (February 2022) and the 72nd International Communication Association (ICA) (May 2022). Below, you can read the titles and abstracts of the works they will present.

- **Title**:  A Content Analytical Study on Celebrities, Influencers and Athletes’ Political Content on Instagram.
- **Authors**: Anaëlle Gonzalez, Desirée Schmuck, Laura Vandenbosch
- **Abstract**: Instagram and its many famous personae are now the main news providers for a majority of users (Newman et al., 2021). To date, no study has systematically investigated the political content that influencers and celebrities may share on their Instagram accounts and the way these opinion leaders frame these issues. This content analytical study examined the 1,256 Instagram permanent posts and 2,936 ephemeral stories of 59 opinion leaders (20 sports celebrities, 20 artistic celebrities and 19 influencers) identified as the most popular in Western countries, and documented, for the first time, the prevalence of different news stories and their frames. The multilevel analyses suggested that celebrity type and platform feature significantly predicted political posting and the use of the attribution of responsibility frame. Celebrity type and sex also partly predicted which political topics were shared.

- **Title**: The Development and Validation of the Perceived Digital Balance in Adolescence Scale
- **Authors**: Jasmina Rosič, Luca Carbone, Mariek Vanden Abeele, Bojana Lobe and Laura Vandenbosch
- **Abstract**: Many adolescents are permanently online, permanently connected with their smartphones (Vorderer et al., 2017). These adolescents are challenged to find an adequate balance between the advantages and disadvantages of their ubiquitous connectivity (Vanden Abeele, 2020). Existing smartphone scales typically measure directly observable practices like screen time. As such, measurements that address subjective, lived experiences of being constantly connected (e.g., perceived smartphone effects on wellbeing) are lacking. This gap is addressed by developing the Adolescents’ Perceived Digital Balance Scale.
A semantic-differential measurement was developed with 19-items on a) social interaction and relationships, b) productivity tasks, c) entertainment, and d) emotions. Answer options ranged from “1=very true of me(A)” to “5=very true of me(B)”. The measure was revised by two independent smartphone research experts and five adolescents. A first online survey was organized in summer 2021 to perform an exploratory factor analysis (n=161, Mage=17.87, SD=1.23, 57% girls). A second online survey (n=1.107, Mage=15.27, SD=1.78; 51% boys) was organized in fall 2021 to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis. 
The EFA resulted in a three-factor solution. The first factor consisted of items on hedonic feelings and other emotions (e.g., anxiety) related to smartphone use. The second factor captured how smartphone use could facilitate/discourage social interactions and relationships. The third factor captured smartphone use in relation to productivity (school) tasks. Two items were removed due to low factor loadings or loading on the theoretically incorrect factor. The construct validity of the new subscales was confirmed as they correlated with the Scale of Smartphone Leisure Uses, the Self Esteem Scale, the Social Media Self Control Failure Measure, and Technoference Scale. The CFA indicated a good model fit and configural invariance across gender. 
The introduced instrument is promising to help further disentangling the effects of ubiquitous connectivity on adolescents’ lives.

- **Title**: The Sound of Meritocracy: A Content Analysis of Meritocracy in Popular Music Lyrics Using a Semantic and Syntactic Framing Approach
- **Authors**: Luca Carbone, Laura Vandenbosch, Hyunjin Song
- **Abstract**: Meritocracy is a pervasive narrative in popular culture (Mijs & Savage, 2020). Yet, its presence in music has received scarce attention. This study analyzes the presence and prevalence of meritocratic frames in popular lyrics combining manual and network content analyses. We analyzed the 200 most popular songs on Spotify in six individualistic countries from 2016–2019 (N = 4117). Our analyses found a strong (24% of songs with at least one reference), variegated (five frames) presence of meritocracy. These representations were common in rap (81.7%) but also in pop and rock. Network analysis confirmed these results by analyzing patterns of word co-occurrences. By combining manual and network analyses, we provide suggestions for future research on media and its audience effects.

### 04 January 2022

The first wave data collection of the time study was completed in September-November 2021. 2412 youth aged between 12 and 18 fully completed the questionnaire in the three countries. 590 youth participated in Belgium, 740 in France and 1082 in Slovenia. The survey was about the social media, smartphone, tv series and music with some questions about youth themselves and the society. Participants were informed about some key results emerging from this wave with a debriefing in their respective country language.
