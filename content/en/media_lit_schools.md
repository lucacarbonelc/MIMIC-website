This research is only made possible thanks to the participation of wonderful Media Literate Schools across Belgium, France & Slovenia. These media literate schools chose to expend considerable effort to help further the understanding of media effects on adolescents in Europe. We are thankful for their cooperation and commitment to helping adolescents gain the most out of their media use. 

As token of our gratitude, these schools will receive a digital literacy training package at the end of Project MIMIc. This package will contain a report about the research results, two digital video clips and a discussion guide.

The first digital video clip is targeted at adolescents and explains the results of the research and their implications for the lives of adolescents. Schools are highly supported to motivate teachers and pupils to watch the video clip together and have a discussion about the results afterwards.

To train teachers into experienced moderators for discussions about media literacy skills, a second digital video clip is targeted at teachers and explains them the core attention points that have to be taken into account when moderating classroom discussions about the results of the research.

To organize the discussion, the discussion guide contains a detailed step-wise explanation on how a conversation can unfold and presents several subjects to discuss in class. Schools who implement the digital literacy training package in their curriculum are invited to also ask students to complete a brief survey before and after the training. This survey is analysed by the MIMIc Team and gives the school feedback on the training.

As such, schools that participate in Project MIMIc and make use of the digital literacy training package provided, can truly consider themselves a *Media Literate School*. Fully equipped to help students navigate the complexities of an increasingly digital society.
