abstract: "The question of whether and when the use of digital media (DM), such as social media, streaming platforms, and games, positively and negatively affects children and adolescents’ physical and psychological well-being has garnered significant concern among children, adolescents, and media (CAM) scholars and the broader society in the past decades. These debates are fueled by meta-analytic research reporting inconsistent findings across studies (Orben & Blakemore, 2023; Valkenburg et al., 2021). These inconsistencies have prompted CAM scholars to reevaluate the field, resulting in several important recommendations, such as refinement of theories and concepts, greater diversity in methods, and cross-national and cultural contextualization (Livingstone & Helsper, 2013; Orben & Blakemore, 2023; Valkenburg et al., 2021). One significant factor that has so far been largely overlooked in CAM research and may especially be relevant for reflection as the Journal of Children and Media (JOCAM) reaches its 18th year is the element of time. We define the element of time as a proxy for events and (social) structures that typify the signaled moment in time. This oversight is surprising as opportunities and threats have long been recognized to be dependent on time processes (Baltes, 1987). Consequently, this commentary encourages CAM scholars to reflect on the role and function of time in their research. Specifically, we provide directions for future CAM research on why four frequently overlooked time factors may matter: 1) calendar moment, 2) media novelty, 3) developmental stage, and 4) applied time intervals."
