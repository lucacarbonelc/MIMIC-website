Anaëlle Gonzalez is a PhD student at the Media Psychology Lab (KU Leuven) under the supervision of Associate Professor Laura Vandenbosch. Her PhD is part of the ERC-funded starting grant on Malleable Mediated Ideals and Adolescents’ Wellbeing (MIMIc). Her PhD project focuses on the role that social media, and especially influencers, play in the development of the political and moral self in adolescence. More precisely, she investigates the reciprocal dynamics between the content that influencers and other entertainment figures share on social media and adolescents’ political attitudes and moral values. This project uses a multidisciplinary approach as it combines communication and political science, as well as psychology.
