Caroline Giraudeau is a lecturer at the Department of Psychology (University of Tours, France). She is interested in the relationships between adolescents and young adults and their grandparents, and more particularly in the emotional closeness between them.

Currently, she is involved in several (international) research projects on student-teacher relationships (with the University of Kentucky), a multinational study on emotional traits and relational and psychological health (e.g., stress, depression, self-esteem) (with the University of Arizona), and a cross-cultural study on the relationships and expectations of grandparents and young adults (with Penn State Hazleton University).

She has two interests in the MIMIc project concerning the French participants: What photos and texts do teenagers share about their grandparents in social networks? Friendship during adolescence in social networks: What experience(s) of emotional closeness do French adolescents have with their peers and with celebrities?
