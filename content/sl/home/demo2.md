Projekt MIMIc: projekt za razumevanje vloge medijev v življenju fantov in deklet v obdobju 2020–2025

“Do young people mimic the lifestyles they encounter on their social media feed and in entertainment fiction?” is at the core of the research conducted by the MIMIc team in Belgium, France and Slovenia across 3000 adolescents. The project seeks to learn how young people enrich their lives with the affordances offered by the rich digital media landscape in which they grow up. Moreover, we aim to obtain a better understanding of how youth think and feel about being online all the time, constantly exposed to an unlimited stream of information on how their peers organize their lives on social media and in popular entertainment media, such as television shows or music. To build this knowledge, we are conducting various types of studies. In a first set of studies, we analysed the content of celebrities and influencers popular among youth. In this research, we found that music artists tend to showcasing their luxurious lifestyles, such as showing their expensive cars, and to depicting how hard they work to obtain such expensive goods. Moreover, ... (results of other content analyses). In a second set of analyses, we followed a group of youngsters aged 12 to 18 by looking at their social media profiles and by surveying their activities over the course of 1 year to see how they grow-up in a mediated world. In this analyses, we found that ... (results of effect analyses). We also developed two new scales that capture the positive uses that youngsters make of their smartphones for online activities, such as for civil participation, positive social comparison, and authentic self-presentation. The results of the first scale can be found at this [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.975557/full). In addition, we conducted a large analysis synthesizing the existing research about how music, a very popular medium among adolescents, influences the attitudes of its listeners. The results of this study can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qKiSL7zD4SUHM0FdDVPjbpFBwMTrXGf/view). Finally, we will soon conduct a new study in October 2023 where we will be monitoring youngsters through daily surveys to better understand what their day-to-day interactions with social and entertainment media entail.
