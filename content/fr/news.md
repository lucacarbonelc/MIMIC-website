MIMIc members, Anaëlle Gonzalez, Jasmina Rosič, and Luca Carbone, will soon present the first studies of their PhDs at two conferences, the Etmaal van de Communicatiewetenschap (February 2022) and the 72nd International Communication Association (ICA) (May 2022). Below, you can read the titles and abstracts of the works they will present.

- **Title**: The Development and Validation of the Perceived Digital Balance in Adolescence Scale
- **Authors**: Jasmina Rosič, Luca Carbone, Mariek Vanden Abeele, Bojana Lobe and Laura Vandenbosch
- **Abstract**: Many adolescents are permanently online, permanently connected with their smartphones (Vorderer et al., 2017). These adolescents are challenged to find an adequate balance between the advantages and disadvantages of their ubiquitous connectivity (Vanden Abeele, 2020). Existing smartphone scales typically measure directly observable practices like screen time. As such, measurements that address subjective, lived experiences of being constantly connected (e.g., perceived smartphone effects on wellbeing) are lacking. This gap is addressed by developing the Adolescents’ Perceived Digital Balance Scale.
A semantic-differential measurement was developed with 19-items on a) social interaction and relationships, b) productivity tasks, c) entertainment, and d) emotions. Answer options ranged from “1=very true of me(A)” to “5=very true of me(B)”. The measure was revised by two independent smartphone research experts and five adolescents. A first online survey was organized in summer 2021 to perform an exploratory factor analysis (n=161, Mage=17.87, SD=1.23, 57% girls). A second online survey (n=1.107, Mage=15.27, SD=1.78; 51% boys) was organized in fall 2021 to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis. 
The EFA resulted in a three-factor solution. The first factor consisted of items on hedonic feelings and other emotions (e.g., anxiety) related to smartphone use. The second factor captured how smartphone use could facilitate/discourage social interactions and relationships. The third factor captured smartphone use in relation to productivity (school) tasks. Two items were removed due to low factor loadings or loading on the theoretically incorrect factor. The construct validity of the new subscales was confirmed as they correlated with the Scale of Smartphone Leisure Uses, the Self Esteem Scale, the Social Media Self Control Failure Measure, and Technoference Scale. The CFA indicated a good model fit and configural invariance across gender. 
The introduced instrument is promising to help further disentangling the effects of ubiquitous connectivity on adolescents’ lives.

# Luca Carbone
- **Title**: The Sound of Meritocracy: A Content Analysis of Meritocracy in Popular Music Lyrics Using a Semantic and Syntactic Framing Approach
- **Authors**: Luca Carbone, Laura Vandenbosch, Hyunjin Song
- **Abstract**: Meritocracy is a pervasive narrative in popular culture (Mijs & Savage, 2020). Yet, its presence in music has received scarce attention. This study analyzes the presence and prevalence of meritocratic frames in popular lyrics combining manual and network content analyses. We analyzed the 200 most popular songs on Spotify in six individualistic countries from 2016–2019 (N = 4117). Our analyses found a strong (24% of songs with at least one reference), variegated (five frames) presence of meritocracy. These representations were common in rap (81.7%) but also in pop and rock. Network analysis confirmed these results by analyzing patterns of word co-occurrences. By combining manual and network analyses, we provide suggestions for future research on media and its audience effects.
