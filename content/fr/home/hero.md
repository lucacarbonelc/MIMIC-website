A paradigm to understand effects of contemporary media in adolescents’ well-being.

Popular media among adolescents abound with idealised representations of how one should look, talk, behave, and perform in order to acquire more from life. Based on insights from cultural sociology, media theory, and developmental psychology, the current project argues that media not only describe a variety of ideals, but also portray these ideals as models that are within reach for anyone who works hard or follows a certain ‘recipe’. Such representations are labelled as ‘malleable mediated ideals’ and parallel a societal emphasis on individual choice as the prominent route towards self-realisation in all types of roles. The extent to which malleable ideals in media feed this emphasis on individual choice as a way to achieve self-realisation is central in the project. This question is pressing in today’s society as the pressures that adolescents experience are viewed as an important factor in the relatively high prevalence of both internalising and externalising problems in adolescence. Content analytical, diary, and longitudinal studies in three different cultural contexts will be triangulated to develop a theoretical model: the Malleable Ideals Media Effects model (MIME). The project is called MIMIc and thus captures how Malleability In Media Ideals leads adolescents to mimiC and act upon the malleable ideals in their own lives while suffering from the pressure and responsibility attributions accompanying these ideals.
