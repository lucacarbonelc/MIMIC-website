      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from 2017, Laura Vandenbosch is an assistant professor at the School for Mass Communication Research (BOF-ZAP research professorship grant). The relationship between media and well-being is the core subject of her research, leading to international publications in several fields including developmental psychology, sexology, body image, social relationships and communication theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 she was elected as the secretary of the Children, Adolescents and Media Division of the International Communication Association (2015-2018). Laura is currently also an editorial board member of ISI-ranked journals Human Communication Research, Journal of Children and Media, and Communications: The European Journal of Communication Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, she is involved in several (international) research projects aimed to study how media may affect well-being by focusing on factors that have not been understood well, such as the role of social relationships, cultural background, sexualization, media literacy and malleability beliefs. Part of these projects are embedded within the international network she has built throughout the years by spending periods abroad at, for instance, the U of Michigan, the U of Toronto and the U of Vienna. Her work has led to several awards, such as the Top Paper, Top Article and Top Dissertation Awards from the Children, Adolescents and Media (CAM) Division of the International Communication Association (2013-2016) and the Research Council Award in the Humanities (Prijs Onderzoeksraad, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, she received an ERC starting grant for the project “Malleability in mediated ideals: A paradigm to understand effects of contemporary media in adolescents’ well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;

Her PhD project focuses on Adolescents’ Media Diets, the Individualistic Discourse et Political beliefs and Participation.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD student at the School for Mass Communication Research, KU Leuven (BE). My research interests lie at the intersection of media effects, cultural and cognitive sociology. From a theoretical point of view, I study the process of belief formation from an embodied perspective, with particular attention to information encoding and storage of multisensory and linguistic stimuli. I apply this reasoning to the specific case of social inequalities and media framing effects: How do individuals form beliefs about poverty? What relationships between their own and others&amp;rsquo; social class? What role do media have in the formation and internalization of these beliefs? Empirically, I employ quantitative methodologies, such as social network analysis, structural equation modelling, and computational text analysis. I am committed to an open science framework and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Caroline Giraudeau is a lecturer at the Department of Psychology (University of Tours, France). She is interested in the relationships between adolescents and young adults and their grandparents, and more particularly in the emotional closeness between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, she is involved in several (international) research projects on student-teacher relationships (with the University of Kentucky), a multinational study on emotional traits and relational and psychological health (e.g., stress, depression, self-esteem) (with the University of Arizona), and a cross-cultural study on the relationships and expectations of grandparents and young adults (with Penn State Hazleton University).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has two interests in the MIMIc project concerning the French participants: What photos and texts do teenagers share about their grandparents in social networks? Friendship during adolescence in social networks: What experience(s) of emotional closeness do French adolescents have with their peers and with celebrities?&lt;/p&gt;
