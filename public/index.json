Our goal is to broaden the understanding of what it means to grow up in a digital world. “Do youth mimic the lifestyles they encounter on their social media feeds and in entertainment fiction?” is a key question in this project and refers to learning which norms and beliefs youth adopt from interacting with media.\nWe ask this question in hopes of helping youth, such as your child, better navigate the complexities of a digital society and make the most of their social media use. We aim to accomplish this goal by conducting three different studies amongst adolescents across Europe. Below you can find some more information on what these three studies entail. If you have any questions on the ethical measures undertaken by project MIMIc to ensure the wellbeing of every single participant, we would like to direct you to the “Adolescent” section on this website, or the digital information sheet accessible on the online platform of your child’s school.\n  First, the MIMic research team will first look at media that are popular among adolescents to understand the lifestyles that are promoted on these platforms. This research will study music lyrics (for instance the lyrics of Katy Perry or Drake), TV shows (for instance the popular series 13 Reasons Why), Instagram profiles of famous influencers (for instance the Kardashian family) and the Instagram and Snapchat profiles of adolescents. By looking at the subjects that characters in popular TV series talk about, the images that influencers post online and the posts that adolescents share in their social network we learn more about the subjects adolescents are confronted with when using media.\n  Next, the MIMic research team will next follow a group of youngsters aged 12 to 16 years old over the course of one year to see what it’s like to grow-up in a media-filled world. Three countries (i.e., France, Slovenia and Belgium) take part in this ‘panel study’. More precisely, adolescents are asked at three different time points in 2020-2021 to answer a survey online at their home. Adolescents are invited to participate in the survey through their school. In the survey, we ask about adolescents’ media diets and how adolescents think about themselves, their peers, their body, school results and sexuality. With the answers that adolescents give to our questions we learn to understand how media interactions play a role in growing up.\n  Lastly, the MIMIc research team will monitor adolescents, surveying them daily, for a period of 14 days near the end of 2021. The participants in this diary research will be a subset from the pool of participants from the longitudinal research. More precisely, adolescents are asked to complete a diary in the shape of a brief survey online at their home. In this diary survey, we ask about how adolescents have spent their day and in particular focus on their daily media interactions. With this study we learn to understand why on some days youth benefit from spending time with media, while on other days their media interactions seem to be rather fatiguing.\n  ","date":1607295600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607295600,"objectID":"10e6f5c5693a4982aadb39f47f75ad63","permalink":"/parents/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/parents/","section":"","summary":"Dear sir/madam, We are project MIMIc.

What this means is that we are committed to learning which elements from your media use help you or make you happy, and which don’t. In order to gain a better understanding of these things, we want to see how you and your peers use media. If you, like us, are curious about how your experience with media can be improved, maybe we can help each other out!\nWhat do we do?\nWe are organizing research across three different countries (Belgium, Slovenia and France) as part of a European project led by Prof. L. Vandenbosch. We want to gain insights into the media that you and your friends like to use (12 to 17 year-old) and the type of content you often see. Our team aims to understand how adolescents, such as yourself, interact with these messages that appear on social media, television and in popular music lyrics, both over a long period of time and on a daily basis. We would also like to know if and how you post about yourself on social media (e.g., Instagram and TikTok). More generally, we would like to learn more about the relationship between your media use and how you and your peers think about yourselves, each other, your body, your school results and the world around you.\nAfter our research, we would provide you and your school with a report. This report would include tips \u0026amp; tricks to help you manage specific difficulties that come with media. In that way, these reports will help you reap the most benefit from using these media.\nAs a token of appreciation for your participation in our study, you will be given an individual gift voucher (increasing in value as you participate in more parts of the study). In addition, there will also be lotteries to win additional vouchers. The tokens of appreciation are given based on the time you invest in the research. If you decide to revoke the use of your personal data after completing the research, the vouchers will still be given.\nWhat about data confidentiality (your privacy)?\nConfidentiality of identifying data will always be guaranteed. In other words, we promise that the information you provide us will remain private. The obtained research results will be used for scientific research only, these scientific reports will never contain any identifying information (such as your name or birth date). The data are used in agreement with the law (GDPR) and the strict rules set by KU Leuven, University of Tours, University of Ljubljana. You can find more information on the procedures and the confidentiality of the research in information brochures.\nPractical information\nOur project consists of multiple studies. Find more information about each of them below.\nLongitudinal Research\nThe Longitudinal Study is the largest study. Here, we will ask a large group (4500) of students across Europe (Belgium, France \u0026amp; Slovenia) to participate. Taking part in this study is a requirement to be invited for any of the other studies.\nIf you participate in our Longitudinal Study, you will be asked to complete a survey on how you interact with the media at three different time points over the course of one year. These surveys will always be the same, because we want to see if and how your opinion on these topics evolves over time. The survey contains questions about your body, the importance of your appearance, school results, beauty ideals, sexuality, your media use (for instance social media) and how you think about your peers and the world around you.\nDiary Research\nThe Diary Study is smaller in scope than the previous one. Here we will only ask a total of 3000 adolescents to participate.\nIf you are invited to help us with the Diary Study, we will ask you to complete a brief survey at home on how you interact with the media, every evening before bed. This survey will always be the same, because we want to see how your daily experiences affect how you feel about certain things. Completing this survey will take approximately 10 minutes, and can be completed by using a computer, a phone or a tablet with internet connection. The survey contains questions about your body, the importance of your appearance, school results, beauty ideals, your media use (for instance social media) and how you think about your peers and the world around you.\nSocial Media Study\nThe final study we will organize is a social media study. Just like the Diary Study, a smaller group of 1800 adolescents will be asked to participate.\nIf you are invited to participate in our Social Media Study, you will be asked to accept a friendship or follow request from a social media profile specifically designed for the current research. During the time of the data collection, the researchers will be part of your online network, similar to your other friends/followers on these networks. Next, the researchers will take screenshots to investigate the pictures, status updates and messages you post on your social media profiles. Only the researchers have access to the screenshots and will investigate them by calculating, for instance, the number of pictures on a profile before deleting these screenshots permanently.\nResults of the research\nIf you participate in our research, you will receive a report presenting the most important results of the study every six months after the data collection has taken place. These reports will include the findings of the research, but also tips and tricks on how you can optimize your media interactions.\nThank you in advance for your cooperation, your help is greatly appreciated.

This package will contain a report about the research results, two digital video clips and a discussion guide.\nThe first digital video clip is targeted at adolescents and explains the results of the research and their implications for the lives of adolescents. Schools are highly supported to motivate teachers and pupils to watch the video clip together and have a discussion about the results afterwards.\nTo train teachers into experienced moderators for discussions about media literacy skills, a second digital video clip is targeted at teachers and explains them the core attention points that have to be taken into account when moderating classroom discussions about the results of the research.\nTo organize the discussion, the discussion guide contains a detailed step-wise explanation on how a conversation can unfold and presents several subjects to discuss in class. Schools who implement the digital literacy training package in their curriculum are invited to also ask students to complete a brief survey before and after the training. This survey is analysed by the MIMIc Team and gives the school feedback on the training.\nAs such, schools that participate in Project MIMIc and make use of the digital literacy training package provided, can truly consider themselves a Media Literate School.

Drawing on cultural sociology, communication theory, and psychological literature, we introduce the malleability narrative of mediated ideals, described as “a collection of media representations of a variety of ideals that tend to be portrayed as within reach for anyone who is committed to pursuing his/her own self-interest.” The aim of the framework is to foster content analytical research on the occurrence of the malleability narrative in popular media and to stimulate audience research on interactions between media users and the malleability narrative in media, while taking account of different explanatory routes and the heterogeneity of the audience.","tags":["Theory"],"title":"The Malleability Narrative in Entertainment and Social Media.
