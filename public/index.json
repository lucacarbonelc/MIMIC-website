Part of these projects are embedded within the international network she has built throughout the years by spending periods abroad at, for instance, the U of Michigan, the U of Toronto and the U of Vienna. Her work has led to several awards, such as the Top Paper, Top Article and Top Dissertation Awards from the Children, Adolescents and Media (CAM) Division of the International Communication Association (2013-2016) and the Research Council Award in the Humanities (Prijs Onderzoeksraad, 2016).\nIn 2019, she received an ERC starting grant for the project “Malleability in mediated ideals: A paradigm to understand effects of contemporary media in adolescents’ well-being.”\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a7902903c008d4ec721817b3d5164cf4","permalink":"/authors/1admin1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/1admin1/","section":"authors","summary":"Starting from 2017, Laura Vandenbosch is an assistant professor at the School for Mass Communication Research (BOF-ZAP research professorship grant).

The question is answered through three studies in which an adolescent can participate.\n The MIMic research team will first look at media that are popular among adolescents to understand the lifestyles that are promoted in these platforms. This research will study music lyrics (for instance the lyrics of Katy Perry or Drake), TV shows (for instance the popular series 13 Reasons Why), Instagram profiles of famous influencers (for instance the Kardashian family) and the Instagram and Facebook profiles of adolescents. By looking at the subjects that characters in popular TV series talk about, the images that influencers post online and the posts that adolescents share in their social network we learn more about the subjects adolescents are confronted with when using media. The MIMic research team will next follow a group of youngsters aged 12 to 16 years old over the course of 1.5 years to see how grow-up in a mediated world. Three countries (i.e., France, Slovenia and Belgium) take part in the panel study. More precisely, adolescents are asked at three different time points in 2020-2021 to answer a survey online at their home. Adolescents are invited to participate in the survey through their school. In the survey, we ask about adolescents’ media diets and how adolescents think about themselves, their peers, their body, school results and sexuality. With the answers that adolescents give to our questions we learn to understand how media interactions play a role in growing up. The MIMic research team will lastly monitor youth to survey them on a day-to-day basis what the daily interactions with social media and popular TV shows mean. Part of the youngsters who participate in the longitudinal study are also invited in this diary study in 2021-2022. More precisely, adolescents are asked to complete a diary in the shape of a brief survey online at their home during 14 days. In this diary survey, we ask about how adolescents have spent their day and in particular focus on their daily media interactions. With this study we learn to understand why on some days youth benefit from spending time with media, while on other days their media interactions seem to be rather fatiguing.

We developed a framework for the representation of such ideals, and that may increase our understanding of the effects media have on users' well-being. Drawing on cultural sociology, communication theory, and psychological literature, we introduce the malleability narrative of mediated ideals, described as “a collection of media representations of a variety of ideals that tend to be portrayed as within reach for anyone who is committed to pursuing his/her own self-interest.” The aim of the framework is to foster content analytical research on the occurrence of the malleability narrative in popular media and to stimulate audience research on interactions between media users and the malleability narrative in media, while taking account of different explanatory routes and the heterogeneity of the audience.","tags":["Theory"],"title":"The Malleability Narrative in Entertainment and Social Media.
