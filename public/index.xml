      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;digital-literacy-training-package&#34;&gt;Digital literacy training package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating schools receive at the end of the MIMIc project a digital literacy training package. This package contains a report about the research results, two digital video clips and a discussion guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first digital video clip is targeted at adolescents and explains the results of the research and their implications for the lives of adolescents. Schools are highly supported to motivate teachers and pupils to watch the video clip together and have a discussion about the results afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To train teachers into experienced moderators for discussions about media literacy skills, a second digital video clip is targeted at teachers and explains them the core attention points that have to be taken into account when moderating classroom discussions about the results of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To organize the discussion, the discussion guide contains a detailed step-wise explanation on how a conversation can unfold and presents several subjects to discuss in class. Schools who implement the digital literacy training package in their curriculum are invited to also ask students to complete a brief survey before and after the training. This survey is analysed by the MIMIc Team and gives the school feedback on the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monitoring&#34;&gt;Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the MIMIc research project is organized across multiple years (i.e., 2020-2022) schools will receive rapid communication reports when a sub-project has ended in the research. For more information, please

      <title>For Adolescents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Team MIMIc aims to contribute to the improvement of today’s society and help you benefit the most from your media use. In order to do this, we first need to gain information on how you and your peers use media and how you react to the images you see on a daily basis. If, like us, you are curious about the effects of media use, and would like to help your generation gain the most out of their media, maybe we can help each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our research is organized across three different countries (Belgium, Slovenia and France) and is part of a European project led by Prof. L. Vandenbosch. We want to gain insights into the media that you and your friends like to use (12 to 16 year-old) that regularly contain unrealistic messages relating to relationships, school success, body ideals, sexual and social success. Our team aims to understand how adolescents, such as yourself, interact with these messages that appear on social media, television and in popular music lyrics, both over a long period of time and on a daily basis. We would also like to know if and how you post about yourself on social media (e.g Instagram and TikTok). More generally, we would like to learn more about the relationship between media use and how you and your peers think about yourselves, each other, your body, school results and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our research, we would you and your school with a separate report. These reports would include tips &amp;amp; tricks to help you manage specific difficulties that come with social media, such as online privacy, cyberbullying… and thus allowing you to reap the most benefit from using these media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a token of appreciation for your participation in our study, you will be given an individual gift voucher, in addition to participations in lotteries to win additional vouchers. The tokens of appreciation are given based on your time investment in the research. If you decide to revoke the use of your personal data after completing the research, the vouchers will still be given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about data confidentiality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Confidentiality of identifying data will always be guaranteed. The obtained research results will be used for scientific research only, these scientific reports will never contain any identifying information (such as your name or birth date). The data are used in agreement with the law (GDPR) and the strict KU Leuven, University De Tours, University of Ljubljana rules. You can find more information on the procedures and the confidentiality of the research in information brochures. All this information will also be explained orally to you when we visit the school to invite them to participate in our research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our project consists of multiple studies. Find more information about each of them below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-depth interviewes Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
XXXX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longitudinal Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you participate in our Longitudinal Study, they will be asked to complete a questionnaire on how they interact with media at four different time points over the course of two years. These questionnaires will always be the same, because we want to see how your opinion on these topics evolves over time. The questionnaire contains questions about your body, the importance of your appearance, school results, beauty ideals, sexuality, your media use (for instance social media) and how you think about their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diary Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Diary Research study will ask you to complete a brief questionnaire at home on how you interact with media, every evening before bed. This questionnaire will always be the same, because we want to see how your opinion changes depending on your daily experiences. Answering this questionnaire will take approximately 10 minutes, and can be completed by using a computer, a phone or a tablet with internet connection. The questionnaire contains questions about your body, the importance of your appearance, school results, beauty ideals, sexuality, your media use (for instance social media) and how you think about their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content Analytical Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Content Analytical Study is research conducted on your social media profile. If you are invited to take part in this study, you will be asked to accept a friendship or follow request from a social media profile specifically designed for the current research. During the time of the data collection, the researchers will be part of your online network. Next, the researchers will take screenshots to investigate the pictures, status updates and messages posted on your social media profiles. Only the researchers have access to the screenshots and will investigate them by calculating, for instance, the number of pictures on a profile, before deleting these screenshots permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results of the research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you participate in our research, you will receive a report presenting the most important results of the study every six months after the data collection has taken place. These reports will include the findings of the research, but also tips and tricks on how you can optimize your media interactions&lt;br&gt;
Thank you in advance for your cooperation, your help is greatly appreciated.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MIMIc Research
The goal of the MIMIc research is to increase our understandings of what it means to grow up in a digital world. “Do youth mimic the lifestyles hey encounter at their social media walls and in entertainment fiction?” is a key question in the study and refers to learning which norms and beliefs youth adopt from interacting with media. The question is answered through three studies in which an adolescent can participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MIMic research team will first look at media that are popular among adolescents to understand the lifestyles that are promoted in these platforms. This research will study music lyrics (for instance the lyrics of Katy Perry or Drake), TV shows (for instance the popular series 13 Reasons Why), Instagram profiles of famous influencers (for instance the Kardashian family) and the Instagram and Snapchat profiles of adolescents. By looking at the subjects that characters in popular TV series talk about, the images that influencers post online and the posts that adolescents share in their social network we learn more about the subjects adolescents are confronted with when using media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MIMic research team will next follow a group of youngsters aged 12 to 16 years old over the course of 1.5 years to see how grow-up in a mediated world. Three countries (i.e., France, Slovenia and Belgium) take part in the panel study. More precisely, adolescents are asked at three different time points in 2020-2021 to answer a survey online at their home. Adolescents are invited to participate in the survey through their school. In the survey, we ask about adolescents’ media diets and how adolescents think about themselves, their peers, their body, school results and sexuality. With the answers that adolescents give to our questions we learn to understand how media interactions play a role in growing up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MIMic research team will lastly monitor youth to survey them on a day-to-day basis what the daily interactions with social media and popular TV shows mean. Part of the youngsters who participate in the longitudinal study are also invited in this diary study in 2021-2022. More precisely, adolescents are asked to complete a diary in the shape of a brief survey online at their home during 14 days. In this diary survey, we ask about how adolescents have spent their day and in particular focus on their daily media interactions. With this study we learn to understand why on some days youth benefit from spending time with media, while on other days their media interactions seem to be rather fatiguing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
